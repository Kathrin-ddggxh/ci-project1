# Lowland Pride üè≥‚Äçüåà
Welcome to Lowland Pride! This is the website of the Burren Lowland's first LGBTQ+ youth group. 
The site is targeted towards members of the LGBTQ+ community aged 14-25 who live in the rural areas of the at the base of the Burren, centering on Gort, Co. Galway and reaching into West Clare.
The Lowland Pride's site provides young people with a schedule of weekly meet-ups, dates and information on special events and how to join the group.

## Design
This site was created and designed with young adults and teenagers in mind who are looking for information and access to a very specific group in their own locality. The content is short and informative, the style colourful and reassuring.

### Wireframes
- The first wireframe in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wT3sdUsGl5XI6l3T6eq9bs/CI-Project-1?node-id=35%3A111) is a very simple design

## Features
This site implements the very basic features of a static website.

### Existing Features
- **Navigation Bar**
    - Featured in the header of all four pages, includes the club's logo and links to Home page, About page, Events page and Contact form. Uniform format allows for easy navigation on all pages without the use of the "back" button.

### Possible Future Features
- Modal for events page:  

    I would like to implement a modal for the calender events. So far, the details of the weekly events are simply listed and explained below the calender. In future it would be nice to have them pop up in a modal when either hovering or clicking on the events in the calender.
