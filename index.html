        <p class="welcome-text">Welcome to Lowland Pride youth group! We are a community of young LGBTQ+ people
            who all live in and around the Burren Lowland Region. <br> Have a look at what we get up to!</p>

                <h2>A Safe Space</h2>
                <p>The main aim of this group is to create and provide a safe space for young people between 14 and 25
                    who identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community. Whether you need to talk, want to listen or just
                    hang out, the Lowland Pride group offers a supportive environment free of judgement or prejudice. We
                    have a firm set of <a href="#">rules</a> in place to ensure <strong>everybody</strong> feels
                    comfortable and happy in our group.

                <h2>New Connections</h2>
                <p>Having a support network is important. And sometimes we need those around us who share in the same
                    experiences we have. At Lowland Pride we are trying to bring together members of a rurally dispersed
                    young community who are looking for like-minded people. Connect with others who can relate to you
                    and vice versa. </p>

            <div class="main-info-tile">
                <h2>Having the Craic</h2>
                <p>All talk and no fun makes young Pride members dull people. Whatever we're dealing with in life, being
                    able to relax and have fun with friends helps us get through it. That's why we make sure we get in
                    plenty of laughs. Apart from our weekly hangout meet-ups, we organise events and outings throughout
                    the year to blow out the cobwebs. Head over to our <a href="#">events</a> page to find out more.</p>
