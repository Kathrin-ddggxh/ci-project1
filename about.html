                <h2 class="main-info-heading">Who</h2>
                <p>Our colourful group started out in 2022. Since then we've been welcoming all members of the LGBTQ+
                    community (age 14-25) from the Slieve Aughties to the Burren Highlands and from Kinvara to
                    Crusheen. Of course anybody living outside these areas is welcome to join!</p>

            <div class="main-info-tile">
                <h2 class="main-info-heading">Why</h2>
                <p>Growing up can be challenging. Growing up as part of a minority group even more so. Especially for
                    those of us who live in sparcely populated areas. Finding others who face the same challenges as us
                    may seem difficult. This is why Lowland Pride aims to bring those together who share a connection.

                <h2 class="main-info-heading">What</h2>
                <p>During our regular meet-ups we share a space where we can all feel safe and unjudged while having fun
                    and discovering ourselves. Be it during our sharing sessions, our game nights or special events and
                    outings. Feel free to discuss whatever's bugging you. Suggest a cool activity the group could do
                    together. And ask as many questions as you need without fear of prejudice. <br>Head over to our <a
